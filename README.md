WIP; fields with the question mark (?) at the end are not required

### Event management
//TO DO: add a confirmation dialog
* `/event-create [name] [tag] [default-stage?]` - Create an event with a unique alphanumerical tag. The first stage is set by default to Qualifiers. // TO DO: make a default participation role for the event

* `/event-delete [tag]` - Delete the event with the given tag.

* `/event-info [tag?]` - Show general info about the active event. Additionally providing a tag will instead search for that event instead. This command is available to everyone and will return an ephemeral answer.

* `/event-set-active [tag]` - Set the event as active/default for the current server. This means that all commands submitted by participants in the server will automatically be attached to this event.

* `/event-team-size [min] [max]` - Change the team size values of the active event. The defaults when creating any event are `min: 2`, `max: 5`.

* `/event-registrations-state [state]` - Change the registrations state of the active event. Participants will be able to register teams only while the registrations are open. False by default.

* `/event-submissions-state [state]` - Change the submissions state of the active event. Participants will be able to submit entries only while the submissions are open. False by default.

* `/event-stage [name] [order]` - Modify a given stage of the active event. This command has different actions:
    - If the provided name is unique, create a new stage
    - If the provided order is 0, delete the stage with the provided name
    - All other cases will update the stage with the provided name

* `/event-archive [tag] [state]` - Archive/unarchive an event. Archived events will be locked from any changes both by admins and participants.
